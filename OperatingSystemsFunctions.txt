Function1:
A very important function for OS is to Administer Security;
    -OS Security controls who can use the computing resource.
        -The Administrator of the computer creates user accounts granting access.
        -Depending on the account privilege, the user could/could not use or install certain hardware or software.
    -Controls what software can run in the OS.
        -Modern OS now checks for valid Windows Encrypted signatures on any application.  It will recommend to not install untrusted software.
    -Controls at what time and in what location can the computer be used.

Function 2:
Another important function of OS is to handle OS updates:
    -Practically every modern OS handles updates in an automatic fashion.
    -Automatic updates is the best way to manage patching of security exploits.
    -OS reliability improvements are also distributed through this process.
    -The second best case is to update manually.  However, that opens room for infections if the update is not applied in timely fashion.
