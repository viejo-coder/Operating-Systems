Function1:
A very important function for OS is to Administer Security;
    -OS Security controls who can use the computing resource.
        -The Administrator of the computer creates user accounts granting access.
        -Depending on the account privilege, the user could/could not use or install certain hardware or software.
    -Controls what software can run in the OS.
        -Modern OS now checks for valid Windows Encrypted signatures on any application.  It will recommend to not install untrusted software.
    -Controls at what time and in what location can the computer be used.

Function 2:
Another important function of OS is to handle OS updates:
    -Practically every modern OS handles updates in an automatic fashion.
    -Automatic updates is the best way to manage patching of security exploits.
    -OS reliability improvements are also distributed through this process.
    -The second best case is to update manually.  However, that opens room for infections if the update is not applied in timely fashion.

Function 3:
Performance monitoring is an OS function that is very useful;
    -Provides information on what applications are running and what resources are being used by the applications.
    -The monitoring process provides information on "hung" applications.  Usually these monitoring OS services provide ways to "terminate" the application process that is malfunctioning.
    -Process monitor in multitasking/multiuser OS provides information on who is using up CPU resources with what applications.  
        -This is very helpful when the distributed OS CPU load is being allocated to a specific account/application.
        -This could mean that an application is in a "run-away" state consuming as much resources as it possibly can.
        -The process monitor can be configured by the Administrator to provide logs to understand who, what, where.
